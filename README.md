Link to ask for python fsl-flica code


If you want to use the flica code from fsl, in an updated and improved python version, please send an email to a.llera@donders.ru.nl or llera.a1@gmail.com.
The code is in a private repository so far but you can access it after obtaining consent.

Thanks for your understanding
cheers
